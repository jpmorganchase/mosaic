# {meta.title}

The Storybook source is used to pull individual stories from Storybook, based on tags.

The Mosaic source will filter your Storybook's stories, based on `title` or `tags`.

For each matching story, a page is created in the Mosaic file-system.

- additional Mosaic tags can be added to each page using `additionalTags`
- additional Mosaic metadata can be added to each page using `additionalData`

This information can be used to create a dynamic index of stories from Storybook.

## Installation

`yarn add @jpmorganchase/mosaic-source-storybook`

## Configuration

The Storybook source is an [`HttpSource`](./https-source) and shares the same base configuration.
The `transformResponseToPagesModulePath` prop has a default transformer which creates a page for each matching Story.

The `stories` option is an array of Storybook urls that are used as Sources.
Each story is matched on `title` using the `filter` Regexp (or by `filterTags`).

If specified, `additionalTags` and `additionalData` can be added to any matching pages.
