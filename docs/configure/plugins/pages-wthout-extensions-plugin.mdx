# {meta.title}

The `PagesWithoutFileExtPlugin` plugin creates [aliases](../../author/aliases) without the file extension for every page in the Mosaic filesystem.
This allows pages to be retrieved from the filesystem without specifying the extension e.g., `.mdx`.

The plugin also modifies the `route` metadata property of a page to point to the shorter alias.

## Priority

This plugin runs with a priority of 1. It must run after the [$AliasPlugin](./alias-plugin).

## Adding to Mosaic

This plugin is included in the mosaic config shipped by the Mosaic standard generator. So if you use the below import in your `mosaic.config.mjs` file then the plugin is included already:

```js
import mosaicConfig from '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-standard-generator/dist/fs.config.js';
```

To add it yourself, add the following to the `plugins` collection:

```js
plugins: [
  {
    modulePath: '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-plugins/PagesWithoutFileExtPlugin',
    options: {},
    priority: 1
  }
  // other plugins
];
```
