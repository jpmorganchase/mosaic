# {meta.title}

The `BrokenLinksPlugin` will identify any broken links in pages Mosaic has pulled into it's filesystem by making use of the [check-links](https://www.npmjs.com/package/check-links) package.

It can identify broken links between the pages themselves and external links that pages link out to.

What this plugin is really checking is "liveness" of a link.

- alive if the URL is reachable (2XX status code)
- dead if the URL is not reachable
- invalid if the URL was parsed as invalid or used an unsupported protocol

<Callout variant="warning">
  Links may be "alive", but the **content** of the linked page may not be what you want so continue
  to check links show what you expect.
</Callout>

## Priority

This plugin runs with no special priority.

## Options

| Property      | Description                                                                                                                       |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| baseUrl       | This is used to calculate the full url for links between pages. It should be the url Mosaic is running on                         |
| proxyEndpoint | If you are behind a corporate proxy, external link checking will not work unless you specify the proxy endpoint using this option |

## Adding to Mosaic

This plugin is **not** included in the mosaic config shipped by the Mosaic standard generator so it must be added manually to the `plugins` collection:

```js
plugins: [
  {
    modulePath: '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-plugins/BrokenLinksPlugin',
    priority: -1,
    // Exclude this plugin in builds
    runTimeOnly: true,
    options: {
      baseUrl: process.env.MOSAIC_ACTIVE_MODE_URL || 'http://localhost:8080',
      proxyEndpoint: 'http://some-proxy-url'
    }
  }
  // other plugins
];
```

<Callout>
  This plugin needs to be a `runtimeOnly` plugin because it needs Mosaic to be running in order to
  make requests to all of the page links.
</Callout>

## Example Output

When a link is found to be broken, you will see the following output in the console:

```
@jpmorganchase/mosaic-site:serve: 8080 [Mosaic] Broken links found in /local/docs/publish-site-to-vercel.mdx
@jpmorganchase/mosaic-site:serve: 8080   Link to https://nextjs.org/davie is dead {
@jpmorganchase/mosaic-site:serve: 8080     type: 'link',
@jpmorganchase/mosaic-site:serve: 8080     title: null,
@jpmorganchase/mosaic-site:serve: 8080     url: 'https://nextjs.org/davie',
@jpmorganchase/mosaic-site:serve: 8080     children: [ { type: 'text', value: 'Next.Js', position: [Object] } ],
@jpmorganchase/mosaic-site:serve: 8080     position: {
@jpmorganchase/mosaic-site:serve: 8080       start: { line: 4, column: 20, offset: 36 },
@jpmorganchase/mosaic-site:serve: 8080       end: { line: 4, column: 55, offset: 71 }
@jpmorganchase/mosaic-site:serve: 8080     }
@jpmorganchase/mosaic-site:serve: 8080   }
```
