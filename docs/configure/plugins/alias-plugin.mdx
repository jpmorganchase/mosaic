# {meta.title}

The `$AliasPlugin` is what powers the [aliases](../../author/aliases) feature of Mosaic.

It does this by scrapes `aliases` from page metadata and also applies all aliases stored in `config.data.aliases`

Other plugins can use `setAliases` to apply new aliases, as long as they call it before this plugin has reaches the `$beforeSend` lifecycle event.

This plugin is added to the plugins collection by Mosaic itself so users do _not_ need to include it in their own mosaic config file.

## Priority

This plugin runs with a priority of -1 so it runs _after_ most other plugins.
