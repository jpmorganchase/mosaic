# {meta.title}

The `$TagPlugin` powers the tags feature of Mosaic.

This plugin scrapes `$tag` from page metadata and also applies all aliases stored in `config.data.tags`.

Tags ultimately resolve down into [refs](../../author/refs), but are different from normal refs, in that they are applied to the
union filesystem (all merged filesystems), not to the individual source filesystem that they were defined on. This can be thought of as a _global ref_.

Other plugins can use `config.setData()` and modify the `tags` property, to apply new global refs, as long as
they do so before this plugin has reaches `$beforeSend`.

## Priority

This plugin runs with no special priority but it must run before both the `$AliasPlugin` and the `$RefPlugin`.

## Example use case - Products Page

Let's assume there is a products page on your site and each product is shown as a tile. The information for each product tile is sourced from multiple Mosaic sources. How can tags be used to reference the product data needed for each tile on the products page?

The product page should add a `$tag` metadata prop to its frontmatter:

```yml
---
title: Products
description: Product index
layout: ProductPreview
data:
  items:
    $tag: product#/data
---
```

The tag shown in the example above is saying populate `data.items` of the Products index page with the `data` metadata property of pages tagged with `product`.

A tagged product page needs to have a `tags` property which is a collection of tags and one of these needs to be `product`. This will allow the `$TagPlugin` to correctly associate the product page to the product index page. It will also need a `data` property because thats the property our product index page wants to use for the tiles.

```yml
---
title: Product A
description: My Product description
layout: ProductDiscover
tags:
  - product
data:
  name:
    $ref: '#/title'
  date: 2023/02/07
  action: Product Overview
  description:
    $ref: '#/description'
  link: /products/a/index
---
```

```yml
---
title: Product B
description: My Product description
layout: ProductDiscover
tags:
  - product
data:
  name:
    $ref: '#/title'
  date: 2023/02/07
  action: Product Overview
  description:
    $ref: '#/description'
  link: /products/b/index
---
```
