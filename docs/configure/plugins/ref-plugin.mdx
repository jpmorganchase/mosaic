# {meta.title}

The `$RefPlugin` powers the [refs](../../author/refs) feature of Mosaic.

The plugin scrapes `$ref` properties from page metadata and also applies all refs stored in `config.data.refs`.

Other plugins can use `config.setRef` to apply new refs, as long as they call it before this plugin has reaches `$beforeSend`.

## Priority

This plugin runs with a priority of -1 so it runs _after_ most other plugins.
