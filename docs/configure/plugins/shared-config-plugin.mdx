# {meta.title}

The `SharedConfigPlugin` crawls the page hierarchy to find the closest `sharedConfig` metadata from any parent index's page metadata. It then exports a JSON file into each directory with the merged config for that level.

Shared config is typically the place where the following is configured for a Mosaic site:

- App Header configuration including site name and main navigation
- Footer information
- Help links for the left sidebar area

### Namespace Shared Configs

Consider 2 sources the share the same [namespace](../sources/index#source-namespace) "product-docs":

- Source A - multiple product directories and main product index page. The index page specifies `sharedConfig` metadata.
- Source B - pages relevant to a single product. Index page does _not_ have any `sharedConfig` metadata.

Let's also assume that the pages from Source B would also naturally "fit" within the pages of Source B (e.g. inside a products directory).

In this scenario, the `SharedConfigPlugin` will attempt to copy the shared config file from Source A into the root directory of Source B allowing the Source B pages to use the Source A `sharedConfig` as though it were a product sourced directly from Source A.
