# {meta.title}

The fourth lifecycle event to trigger overall and the second to trigger inside the main Mosaic process.

It is called every time _any_ source emits new pages and should return a boolean to indicate if **other** sources should clear their cache in response to the source updating.

<Callout variant="warning">
  Only sources that have already run `afterUpdate` will call this lifecycle hook since there is no
  cache to clear if they haven't reached that stage in the lifecycle.
</Callout>

The `shouldClearCache` lifecycle event is called with:

- updatedSourceFilesystem - Immutable filesystem for the source that changed i.e, not the source filesystem
- helpers - an object with useful methods
- options - the options specified for the plugin in the mosaic config file

## Helpers
