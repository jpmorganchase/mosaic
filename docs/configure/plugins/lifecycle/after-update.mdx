# {meta.title}

The third lifecycle event to trigger overall and the first to trigger inside the main Mosaic process.

Calls after the filesystem and symlinks have been reconstructed due to a change to the current source pages. Pages will _not_ be cached when read at this stage, to allow for reading content and writing a new copy of it without the cached version taking effect.
This method is safe to use with lazy loading, as the filesystem should return the full page when read.

The `afterUpdate` lifecycle event is called with:

- mutableFilesystem - Mutable filesystem instance with all of this source's pages inside (and symlinks re-applied)
- helpers - an object with useful methods
- options - the options specified for the plugin in the mosaic config file

## Helpers

The helpers provided with this lifecycle event are listed in the table below.

| Property         | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| serialiser       | A matching `Serialiser` for serialising/deserialising pages when reading/writing to the filesystem                                                                  |
| config           | An immutable object for reading data from other lifecycle phases of all plugins for this source in the child process for this plugin. Shared only with this source. |
| globalConfig     | An immutable object for reading data from other lifecycle phases of all plugins. Shared across all sources.                                                         |
| sharedFilesystem | Mutable filesystem instance independent of any sources. Useful for global pages, like sitemaps                                                                      |
| globalFilesystem | Immutable union filesystem instance with all source's pages (and symlinks applied)                                                                                  |
| pageExtensions   | A collection of pageExtensions the source is using                                                                                                                  |
