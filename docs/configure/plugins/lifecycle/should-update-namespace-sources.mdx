# {meta.title}

The fifth lifecycle event to trigger overall and the third to trigger inside the main Mosaic process.

It is called every time _any_ source emits new pages and should return a boolean to indicate if **other sources that share the same [source namespace](../../sources/index#source-namespace)** should re-run `afterUpdate`.

The `shouldUpdateNamespaceSources` lifecycle event is called with:

- updatedSourceFilesystem - Immutable filesystem for the source that changed i.e, not the source filesystem
- helpers - an object with useful methods
- options - the options specified for the plugin in the mosaic config file

## Helpers

The helpers provided with this lifecycle event are listed in the table below.
