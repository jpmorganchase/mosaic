# {meta.title}

The first lifecycle event to trigger after receiving pages from a source and runs in a child process.
The pages can safely be mutated and will be reflected in the final filesystem that gets generated.
It **must** return a collection of pages.

The `$afterSource` lifecycle event is called with:

- pages - the collection of pages emitted by the source
- helpers - an object with useful methods
- options - the options specified for the plugin in the mosaic config file

## Helpers

The helpers provided with this lifecycle event are listed in the table below.

| ignorePages    | A collection of page globs that are to be ignored for this source                                                                          |
