# Plugin lifecycle

The plugin lifecycle is triggered when a source emits content.

Each Mosaic source has its own worker thread and plugin lifecycle events that start with a `$` will execute inside the worker thread.
All other lifecycle events will execute in the main Mosaic process.

The 5 lifecycle events are:

1. [$afterSource](./after-source)
2. [$beforeSend](./before-send)
3. [afterUpdate](./after-update)
4. [shouldClearCache](./should-clear-cache)
5. [shouldUpdateNamespaceSources](./should-update-namespace-sources)

<Callout variant="caution">
  Plugin methods that trigger inside the main thread should be asynchronous and highly optimised to
  avoid holding up the main thread.
</Callout>
