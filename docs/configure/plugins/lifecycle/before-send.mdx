# {meta.title}

The second lifecycle event to trigger and does so after a filesystem has been built up from the source pages.

It is the last lifecycle event to run in a source child process before the filesystem is sent to the main Mosaic process and should **not** return a value.

The `$beforeSend` lifecycle event is called with:

- mutableFilesystem - Mutable virtual filesystem instance with all of this source's pages inside (and symlinks applied)
- helpers - an object with useful methods
- options - the options specified for the plugin in the mosaic config file

## Helpers

The helpers provided with this lifecycle event are listed in the table below.
