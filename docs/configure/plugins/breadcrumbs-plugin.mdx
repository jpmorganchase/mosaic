# {meta.title}

The `BreadcrumbsPlugin` is responsible for generating the data needed to show breadcrumbs navigation on pages. It then appends this data to a `breadcrumbs` property in the page metadata.

Should a page already have a `breadcrumbs` property in it's metadata then it is respected and not overwritten.

If a page has a `sidebar.label` property in it's metadata then this is used as the label for the breadcrumb, otherwise the page `tile` is used.

When the `BreadcrumbsPlugin` is traversing up directories, it needs to know what page in the directory represents the _breadcrumb_ for that directory. It is recommended to use the `index` page for this but the page to use is a configurable option of the breadcrumbs plugin.

## Priority

This plugin runs with no special priority.

## Adding to Mosaic

This plugin is included in the mosaic config shipped by the Mosaic standard generator. So if you use the below import in your `mosaic.config.mjs` file then the breadcrumbs plugin is included already:

```js
import mosaicConfig from '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-standard-generator/dist/fs.config.js';
```

To add it yourself, add the following to the `plugins` collection:

```js
plugins: [
  {
    modulePath: '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-plugins/BreadcrumbsPlugin',
    options: {
      indexPageName: 'index.mdx'
    }
  }
  // other plugins
];
```
