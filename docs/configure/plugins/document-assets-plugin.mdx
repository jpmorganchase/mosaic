# {meta.title}

The `DocumentAssetsPlugin` is responsible for copying assets from a document sub-directory to the public folder of your site. This is particularly useful for co-locating images within your document structure and referencing them from documents using relative paths.

## Co-locating Images

A common use case is to store images within the same directory structure as your documents. This allows you to reference images using relative paths.

For example, to load an image (`mosaic.jpg`) from a sub-directory called `images`, relative to the document's path, you can use the following Markdown:

```markdown
![alt text](./images/mosaic.jpg)
```

This will render the image as follows:
![alt text](./images/mosaic.jpg)

## Centralized Image Directory

Alternatively, if you prefer to store all your images in a common parent directory, you can reference them using a relative path that navigates up the directory structure.

For example, to load an image from a common parent directory, you can use:

```
![alt text](../../images/mosaic.jpg)
```

## Handling Absolute Paths and URLs

The plugin ignores image paths that start with a leading slash (/) or are fully qualified URLs. This ensures that only relative paths are processed and copied to the public folder.

```
![alt text](/images/mosaic.jpg)
![alt text](https://www.saltdesignsystem.com/img/hero_image.svg)
```

## Priority

## Adding to Mosaic

This plugin is **not** included in the mosaic config shipped by the Mosaic standard generator so it must be added manually to the `plugins` collection:

```js
plugins: [
  {
    modulePath: '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-plugins/DocumentAssetsPlugin',
    priority: -1,
    options: {
      srcDir: `../../docs`,
      outputDir: './public/images/mosaic',
      assetSubDirs: ['**/images'],
      imagesPrefix: '/images'
    }
  }
  // other plugins
];
```
