# {meta.title}

The `PublicAssetsPlugin` is responsible for finding "assets" in the Mosaic filesystem and copying them to another directory.

Typical usecase is for copying `sitemap.xml` and `search-data.json` to the public directory of a Next.js site as these are considered [static assets](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/static-assets) for Next.js.

## Priority

This plugin runs with no special priority.

| outputDir | The directory to copy the assets to. Defaults to `./public` |
| assets    | A collection of filenames to copy to the outputDir          |

## Adding to Mosaic

This plugin is **not** included in the mosaic config shipped by the Mosaic standard generator so it must be added manually to the `plugins` collection:

```js
plugins: [
  {
    modulePath: '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-plugins/PublicAssetsPlugin',
    priority: -1,
    options: {
      outputDir: './public',
      assets: ['sitemap.xml', 'search-data.json']
    }
  }
  // other plugins
];
```
