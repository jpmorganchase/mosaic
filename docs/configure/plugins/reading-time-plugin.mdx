# {meta.title}

The `ReadingTimePlugin` generates an estimation of how long a page written in MDX will take to read and adds the `readingTime` property to the metadata of a page.

## Priority

This plugin runs with no special priority.

## Adding to Mosaic

This plugin is included in the mosaic config shipped by the Mosaic standard generator. So if you use the below import in your `mosaic.config.mjs` file then the plugin is included already:

```js
import mosaicConfig from '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-standard-generator/dist/fs.config.js';
```

To add it yourself, add the following to the `plugins` collection:

```js
plugins: [
  {
    modulePath: '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-plugins/ReadingTimePlugin',
    options: {}
  }
  // other plugins
];
```
