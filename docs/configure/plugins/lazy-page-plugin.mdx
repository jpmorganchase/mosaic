# {meta.title}

The `LazyPagePlugin` attempts to reduce the size of the Mosaic filesystem in memory by moving page metadata and content to disk.

It then adds a hook, so that when a page is requested the data is loaded from disk and combined with what is already in the Mosaic filesystem.

<Callout variant="warning">
  It must be the very last to run so that it can strip off metadata and content after other plugins
  have finished with them.
</Callout>

## Priority

This plugin runs with a priority of -2. Needs to be the last to run for biggest impact.

## Options

| Property | Description                                                                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| cacheDir | The directory to store the cache. Defaults to `.mosaic-lazy-page-plugin-cache` |

## Adding to Mosaic

This plugin is included in the mosaic config shipped by the Mosaic standard generator. So if you use the below import in your `mosaic.config.mjs` file then the plugin is included already:

```js
import mosaicConfig from '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-standard-generator/dist/fs.config.js';
```

To add it yourself, add the following to the `plugins` collection:

```js
plugins: [
  {
    modulePath: '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-plugins/LazyPagePlugin',
    // This plugin must be the very last to run, so it can strip off metadata and content after the other
    // plugins are done with them
    priority: -2,
    // Exclude this plugin in builds
    runTimeOnly: true,
    options: {
      cacheDir: '.tmp/.pull-docs-last-page-plugin-cache'
    }
  }
  // other plugins
];
```

<Callout>
  This plugin needs to be a `runtimeOnly` plugin because the goal is to reduce the in-memory
  filesystem size.
</Callout>
