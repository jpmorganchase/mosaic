# {meta.title}

The `SearchIndexPlugin` is responsible for generating the search index and configuration information for [Fuse.js](https://www.fusejs.io/) which is the matching engine powering the client-side search functionality of Mosaic sites.

It outputs 3 files:

- Full Search Index - `search-data.json`
- Condensed Search Index - `search-data-condensed.json`
- Search Configuration - `search-config.json`

### Full Search Index

On a Mosaic site, the full index is fetched after a page has loaded, thus removing the chance of a huge index slowing down first-load.

Practically, the full index should load in the background before a user searches for something, but should a search be initiated before that (e.g., slow-internet) then the condensed version of the search index is available.

### Condensed Search Data

Search Index plugin creates a "condensed" version of the search index that only includes the `title` and `route` for each page. This is the "Minimum Viable Index" to provide somewhat useable search results client-side while the main search index is loaded in the background.

### Search Configuration

Any [options](https://www.fusejs.io/api/options.html) that need to be passed to Fuse.js.

## Adding to Mosaic

This plugin is included in the mosaic config shipped by the Mosaic standard generator. So if you use the below import in your `mosaic.config.mjs` file then the plugin is included already:

```js
import mosaicConfig from '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-standard-generator/dist/fs.config.js';
```

To add it yourself, add the following to the `plugins` collection:

```js
plugins: [
  {
    modulePath: '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-plugins/SearchIndexPlugin',
    previewDisabled: true,
    options: { maxLineLength: 240, maxLineCount: 240 }
  }
  // other plugins
];
```

<Callout variant="warning">
  It's usually a good idea to mark this plugin as disabled for preview sources otherwise the pages
  from the preview will appear in search results.
</Callout>
