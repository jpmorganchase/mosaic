# {meta.title}

Mosaic Plugins are lifecycle-based hooks that are called on _every_ source at different stages. You will never need to invoke a lifecycle method directly as their execution is managed by a plugin runner.

Plugins enable Mosaic to have a lightweight and flexible, modular architecture by encapsulating features in a plugin

## Installation

`yarn add @jpmorganchase/mosaic-plugins`

## Configuration

Plugins are added to the `plugins` collection of the mosaic config file. Like [sources](../sources/index), plugins have an options property that can be used to provide plugin specific configuration.

| Property    | Description                                                                 | Required |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| modulePath  | The path to the installed plugin module                                     | Yes      |
| disabled    | Exclude this plugin completely. Defaults to false                           | No       |
| runtimeOnly | Exclude this plugin when generating a snapshot. Defaults to false           | No       |
| priority    | The importance of this plugin. This highest number plugin will be run first | No       |
| options     | Collection of other configuration values                                    | No       |

## Plugin lifecycle

The plugin lifecycle is triggered when a source emits content.
Whether the execution happens on the main thread or the source worker thread depends on which lifecycle event is called. There are 4 lifecycle events:

1. [$afterSource](./lifecycle/after-source)
2. [$beforeSend](./lifecycle/before-send)
3. [afterUpdate](./lifecycle/after-update)
4. [shouldClearCache](./lifecycle/should-clear-cache)

<Callout variant="caution">
  Plugin methods that trigger inside the main thread should be async and highly optimised to avoid
  holding up the main thread.
</Callout>

## Mosaic Plugins

Mosaic ships with many plugins, most of which are enabled when using the standard generator.

```
plugins: [
    {
      modulePath: '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-plugins/SiteMapPlugin',
      options: {}
    },
    {
      modulePath: '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-plugins/SearchIndexPlugin',
      options: { maxLineLength: 240, maxLineCount: 240 }
    },
    {
      modulePath: '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-plugins/BreadcrumbsPlugin',
      options: {
        indexPageName: 'index.mdx'
      }
    },
    {
      modulePath: '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-plugins/LazyPagePlugin',
      // This plugin must be the very last to run, so it can strip off metadata and content after the other
      // plugins are done with them
      priority: -2,
      // Exclude this plugin in builds
      runTimeOnly: true,
      options: {
        cacheDir: '.tmp/.pull-docs-last-page-plugin-cache'
      }
    },
    {
      modulePath: '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-plugins/PagesWithoutFileExtPlugin',
      options: {}
    },
    {
      modulePath: '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-plugins/SidebarPlugin',
      options: {
        filename: 'sidebar.json'
      }
    },
    {
      modulePath: '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-plugins/ReadingTimePlugin',
      options: {}
    },
    {
      modulePath: '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-plugins/SharedConfigPlugin',
      options: {
        filename: 'shared-config.json'
      },
      priority: 3
    },
    {
      modulePath: '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-plugins/TableOfContentsPlugin',
      options: {
        minRank: 1,
        maxRank: 3
      }
    }
  ]
```
