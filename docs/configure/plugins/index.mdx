Mosaic Plugins are [lifecycle-based](./lifecycle/index) hooks that are called on _every_ source at different stages. You will never need to invoke a lifecycle method directly as their execution is managed by a plugin runner.

Plugins enable Mosaic to have a lightweight and flexible, modular architecture by encapsulating features and functionality as plugins.

## Installation

`yarn add @jpmorganchase/mosaic-plugins`

## Configuration

Plugins are added to the `plugins` collection of the mosaic config file. Like [sources](../sources/index), plugins have an options property that can be used to provide plugin specific configuration.

| Property        | Description                                                                | Required |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| modulePath      | The path to the installed plugin module                                    | Yes      |
| disabled        | Exclude this plugin completely. Defaults to false                          | No       |
| runtimeOnly     | Exclude this plugin when generating a snapshot. Defaults to false          | No       |
| previewDisabled | Exclude this plugin for "preview" sources                                  | No       |
| allowMultiple   | Allow multiple instances of this plugin to run.                            | No       |
| priority        | The importance of this plugin. Plugins with the highest priority run first | No       |
| options         | Collection of other configuration values                                   | No       |

```js
 plugins: [
  {
      modulePath: '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-plugins/PagesWithoutFileExtPlugin',
      options: {},
      priority: 1
    },
    {
      modulePath: '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-plugins/SidebarPlugin',
      options: {}
    },
    {
      modulePath: '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-plugins/ReadingTimePlugin',
      options: {}
    }
],
```

<Callout variant="tip">
  There is no need to import the plugin module directly. As long as the plugin is installed, Mosaic
  will be able to import it using the built-in plugin loader.
</Callout>

## Default Plugins

The following plugins are always included by Mosaic, regardless of whether they are present in the plugins collection of the Mosaic config file:

1. [$TagPlugin](./tag-plugin)
2. [$AliasPlugin](./alias-plugin)
3. [$CodeModPlugin](./codemod-plugin)
4. [$RefPlugin](./ref-plugin)

## Plugin errors

Should a plugin fail, the failure will **not** cause a source to close or for any other plugin to not run.

Instead plugin errors are tracked by Mosaic and can be viewed in the `pluginErrors` property available on each source listed by the list sources [admin API](../admin/index).

Plugin errors will be split by lifecycle event and only the lifecycle events used by the loaded plugins used will be shown.

## Multiple Instances

By default, Mosaic will only run one instance of a plugin.

It may be the case that you wish to run the same plugin twice with a slightly different config. To do this, you must have 2 instances listed in the plugins collection and they **both** must set the `allowMultiple` option to `true`.

For example, the config below runs the [SidebarPlugin](./sidebar-plugin) twice:

```js
plugins: [
  {
    modulePath: '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-plugins/SidebarPlugin',
    options: { rootDirGlob: 'products/product-a' },
    allowMultiple: true
  },
  {
    modulePath: '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-plugins/SidebarPlugin',
    options: { rootDirGlob: '*/!(product-a)/*' },
    allowMultiple: true
  }
  // other plugins
];
```
