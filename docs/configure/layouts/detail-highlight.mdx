# Layout: Detail Highlight

Initialize with `layout: DetailHighlight` in your page's frontmatter.

This layout is used to promote, share insights, and statistics for a line of business.

This layout should be used for pages with only one level of nesting, therefore, pagination is not eligible for this
layout.
