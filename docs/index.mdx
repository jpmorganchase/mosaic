True to its name, Mosaic brings together several concepts—including content, design and technical infrastructure—to deliver a unified website experience that is truly greater than the sum of its individual parts.

With Mosaic, you can:

<Cards>
  <Card step="01" title="Content Aggregator">
    Don't move your content where it does not belong. Compose content from remote data sources which
    are pulled at runtime by our content aggregator.
  </Card>
  <Card step="02" title="Fully Customisable">
    Visualize your content with your own theme, layouts and components or use the Mosaic Design
    language.
  </Card>
  <Card step="03" title="Easily Extended">
    Extend the existing code and add your own content source types through our simple plugin
    architecture.
  </Card>
  <Card step="04" title="Hybrid Deployment">
    Publish your content through Server Side Rendering (SSR) or generate a snapshot of your content
    and serve it as a Statically Generated Site (SGS).
  </Card>
</Cards>

Creating a website has never been so easy!
