Out of the box, Mosaic supports documents written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) which allows React components to be embedded within regular markdown syntax.

In addition to this, the MDX processor has been configured to support additional markdown syntax and features:

- [GitHub flavored markdown (gfm)](https://mdxjs.com/guides/gfm/)
- [Frontmatter](./frontmatter)
