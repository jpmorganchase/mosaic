# {meta.title}

Sidebar data is generated by the the [Sidebar Plugin](../configure/plugins/sidebar-plugin) which by default uses alphabetical ordering of page names to order the sidebar.

## Sidebar frontmatter

A page can add a `sidebar` property to its [frontmatter](./frontmatter) to change the ordering of a sidebar and what title is used for a page in the sidebar.

To rearrange pages in the sidebar or to apply a different label to a page you can specify the following in the page frontmatter:

### Sidebar label

By default the _title_ of a page is used in the sidebar as the label but this can be changed to another label using page frontmatter.

```yaml
---
title: Sidebar Configuration
layout: DetailTechnical
sidebar:
  label: A New Label
---
```

### Sidebar priority

Sidebar priority is a number used to sort the sidebar. Higher the priority pages appear first in the sidebar ordering.

```yaml
---
title: Sidebar Configuration
layout: DetailTechnical
sidebar:
  priority: 10
---
```

## Sidebar Sort Configuration

Sidebar sort configuration allows the sidebar to be sorted using a more sophisticated approach and only needs to be applied to the `index` page of the directory you want to sort.

<Callout variant="warning">
  Priority takes precedence over sort configuration so it can be used to override the sort
  configuration if required.
</Callout>

You must add the sidebar sort configuration to the `sharedConfig.sidebar.sort` property of an **index** page e.g.,

```yaml
sharedConfig:
  sidebar:
    sort:
      field: data/title
      dataType: string
      arrange: desc
```

The properties of the sort configuration are described in the table below:

| Property | Description                                                                                | Required |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| field    | the path, separated by `/`, used to find the value in page frontmatter you wish to sort by | Yes      |
| dataType | is the type of the value. Can be a `string` or `number` or `date`.                         | Yes      |
| arrange  | `asc` or `desc` order                                                                      | yes      |

### Newsletters Example

Let's say you have a _Newsletters_ directory and each page in the directory represents a newsletter. You wish to sort the newsletter sidebar by publication date in descending order (newest first).

One way to do this is to edit each page and add a `priority` which is manually incremented every time a news newsletter is added. Alternatively you can add the following sort configuration to the newsletters index page:

```yaml
sharedConfig:
  sidebar:
    sort:
      field: data/publicationDate
      dataType: date
      arrange: desc
```

This will use the `data.publicationDate` property in each newsletter to sort the newsletters in the sidebar. The publication date is converted to a `date` by the Sidebar Plugin to ensure accurate ordering. There is now no need to increment a priority when a new newsletter is added.

#### Example newsletter page frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: Newsletter 01 Jan 2023
description: Newsletter 01 Jan 2023
data:
  title:
    $ref: '#/title'
  link: /newsletters/2023-01-01
  publicationDate: '2023-01-01'
---
```
