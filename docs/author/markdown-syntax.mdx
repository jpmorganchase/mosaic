# {meta.title}

Out of the box, Mosaic supports documents written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) which allows React components to be embedded within the [basic syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) outlined in the original Markdown design document.

In addition to the basic markdown syntax, the MDX processor used by Mosaic has been configured to support additional markdown syntax and features:

- [GitHub flavored markdown (gfm)](https://mdxjs.com/guides/gfm/)
- [Frontmatter](./frontmatter)

## Mosaic Standard Components

All components that comprise the `components` export from `@jpmorganchase/mosaic-site-components` package are available to use out of the box in your documents.

This includes components for all standard markdown syntax and additional components like `Callout` and `Tile`.

## Referencing Frontmatter

Frontmatter values can be embedded into the page using the `meta` object. See [frontmatter](./frontmatter#accessing-frontmatter-in-content) for more information.

## Configuring Supported components
