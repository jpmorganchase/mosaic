# {meta.title}

Refs are a very powerful feature of Mosaic documents that use [JSON References](https://json-spec.readthedocs.io/reference.html) to reference
a property from the page frontmatter or frontmatter of other pages. For the purposes of the JSON references, the frontmatter of a page can be thought of as the schema.

The key concept is that of a JSON pointer which takes the form **A**#**B** where:

- **A** is the relative path from the current schema to a target schema. If A is empty, the reference is to a type or property in the same schema, an in-schema reference. Otherwise, the reference is to a different schema, a cross-schema reference.
- **B** is the complete path from the root of the schema to a type or property in the schema. If # in not included or B is empty, the reference is to an entire schema.

It's probably better explained with examples...

## Local refs (In-schema reference)

It is possible to reference a page's own frontmatter to avoid duplication:

```
---
title: Refs
layout: DetailTechnical
sidebar:
  priority: 3
data:
  sidebarPriority:
     $ref: '#/sidebar/priority'
---
```

This page you are reading right now has a sidebar priority of **{meta.data.sidebarPriority}**.

The value of `data.sidebarPriority` comes from `sidebar.priority` in the frontmatter.

<Callout>
  Notice that because we don't specify a path before the `#` in the ref we need to put the whole
  value inside quotes.
</Callout>

## Remote Refs (Cross-schema reference)

It is possible to reference frontmatter of other pages. Again this helps avoid duplication but the real power is using refs to build the data model. See [advanced](./advanced) for more information.

The [index](./index) page of the Author section has this frontmatter:

```
---
title: Author
layout: DetailTechnical
sidebar:
  priority: 3
data:
  exampleRefData: Hello from Author page
---
```

This page you are currently looking at is referencing the `data.exampleRefData` in it's frontmatter like this:

```
---
title: Refs
layout: DetailTechnical
sidebar:
  priority: 3
data:
  authorRef:
    $ref: ./#/data/exampleRefData
---
```

I can then use the data and embed it in this page like this:

```
{meta.data.authorRef}
```

And here it is: <strong>{meta.data.authorRef}</strong>

<Callout>
  Notice that we did not need to put `/index` in the ref since index pages are resolved
  automatically.
</Callout>

## Advanced

You have had a taste of the power and want to know more? OK, lets reference and then list out all the mosaic modes:

<ul>
  {meta.data.modes.map(mode => (
    <li key={mode}>{mode}</li>
  ))}
</ul>

The Modes [index](../configure/modes/index) page has this frontmatter:

```
---
title: Modes of operation
layout: DetailTechnical
sidebar:
  priority: 4
data:
  modes:
    $ref: ./*#/title
---
```

The ref here is essentially using a wildcard to grab the title property from the frontmatter of every page in the modes folder.

We can reference that data just like before:

```
---
title: Refs
layout: DetailTechnical
sidebar:
  priority: 3
data:
  modes:
    $ref: ../configure/modes#/data/modes
---
```

### Output as Markdown

With a little code, the referenced data can be embedded in a page.

```
<ul>
  {meta.data.modes.map(mode => (
    <li key={mode}>{mode}</li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

### Output with Mosaic Components

You can use Mosaic components with referenced data as well.

<Tiles>
  {meta.data.modes.map(mode => (
    <TileContent
      title={mode}
      description={`Documentation about ${mode} of Mosaic`}
      eyebrow="Mosaic"
    />
  ))}
</Tiles>

```
<Tiles>
  {meta.data.modes.map(mode => (
    <TileContent
      title={mode}
      description={`Documentation about ${mode} of Mosaic`}
      eyebrow="Mosaic"
    />
  ))}
</Tiles>
```
