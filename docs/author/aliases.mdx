# {meta.title}

Aliases are virtual 'symlinks' of pages, allowing one page to take on one or more other routes.
This is not the same as copying the page, it is a primitive filesystem link which is resolved by Mosaic.

## Use Cases

Aliases are great for linking to an old route if you've moved a page to a new place.
They can also be used to create short hand links to pages or to 'clone' a copy of a page into
another section of the site where it may be relevant.

## Example

This is the frontmatter for this page:

```
---
title: Aliases
layout: DetailTechnical
aliases:
  - /mosaic/example/aliases
---
```

Try accessing this page from [/mosaic/example/aliases](/mosaic/example/aliases)
