 * Renders an Accordion. The Accordion component consists of a series of collapsible panels.
 * Use to maximise space and allow the user to show and hide content.
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 *   <Accordion
 *   panels={[
 *    {
 *       summary: 'Eliminate multiple identity credentials',
 *       content: 'Your content will appear in its own expanded panel',
 *       expanded: true
 *     },
 *     {
 *       summary: 'Passwords and security questions',
 *       content: 'Your content will appear in its own expanded panel',
 *       expanded: false
 *     }
 *   ]}
 * />
 * ```
 *
 * or use it as a compound component and render richer content
 *
 * <Accordion>
 *   <AccordionSection>
 *      <AccordionSummary>
 *          Summary Text
 *      <AccordionSummary>
 *      <AccordionDetails>
