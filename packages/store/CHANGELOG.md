# @jpmorganchase/mosaic-store

## 1.0.0-beta.99

### Minor Changes

- 915b9ae: Secure the content server and editor, fix the save flow, and slim the App Router site
  
  ### Breaking changes
  
  **`@jpmorganchase/mosaic-cli`**
  
  - The `/workflows` WebSocket only runs workflows for messages carrying
    `token` = `MOSAIC_WORKFLOWS_SECRET`; without that env var no workflow
    runs, and the placeholder from `.env.development` only counts when
    `NODE_ENV=development`. Messages are validated (workflow name, user,
    route) and capped at 5 MB.
  - Admin endpoints other than `/_mosaic_/tags/list` require
    `MOSAIC_ADMIN_SECRET`: sent as `x-mosaic-admin-secret`, a bearer token,
    or the password of the browser login prompt (HTTP Basic). Without the
    env var they are open when `NODE_ENV=development` and disabled
    otherwise.
  - CORS headers are no longer sent to every origin. Allow specific
    origins with `MOSAIC_CORS_ORIGINS` (comma-separated).
  
  **Reference site (`packages/site`)**
  
  - Editing requires `MOSAIC_EDITORS` (emails, `@domains` or `*`); when it
    is unset nobody can sign in or edit in production. Set
    `MOSAIC_EDITORS=*` to keep the previous "anyone who can sign in"
    behaviour. Emails and `@domains` only match GitHub emails that
    GitHub has verified.
  - Saves need `MOSAIC_WORKFLOWS_URL` and `MOSAIC_WORKFLOWS_SECRET`
    (renamed from `NEXT_PUBLIC_MOSAIC_WORKFLOWS_URL`).
  - The committed `.env.local` is now `.env.development`, which Next.js
    only loads for `next dev`. Production builds no longer pick up its
    placeholder `AUTH_SECRET` or dev-only flags, and the site refuses the
    placeholder secrets when `NODE_ENV=production`.
  - `.env.prod` is renamed to `.env.production`, the name Next.js actually
    loads for `next build` / `next start`. Production builds therefore now
    default to `MOSAIC_MODE=snapshot-file`; set `MOSAIC_MODE=active` for
    deployments that read from a running Mosaic CLI.
  
  ### Fixes
  
  - **Saving works again.** The CLI echoes the caller's channel (the site
    had switched to a different channel hash, so every progress message
    was dropped and saves never finished), new pages can be created in the
    source whose `prefixDir` contains them (the CLI required the route to
    exist already, and the editor had no route for a new page), and saves
    time out (`MOSAIC_WORKFLOWS_TIMEOUT_MS`, default 5 minutes) and always
    close their socket.
  - Workflow failures are reported to the editor instead of crashing the
    CLI with an unhandled rejection. The GitHub workflow accepts the
    site's `sid` when no `id` is sent.
  - Routes are validated before they are forwarded, and workflows refuse
    to write or rename files outside the source's content folder.
  - Symlinks inside a content folder can no longer publish files from
    outside it (local-folder and git-repo sources, and the CLI's
    `/_mosaic-raw/*` route).
  - Admin responses no longer overwrite git credentials in the live
    config with the redacted value.
  - Search results escape the indexed text before highlighting (it was
    rendered as HTML), escape the query before building a regex, and
    search the current input rather than the previous keystroke.
  - Frontmatter edits are kept when the author leaves the Frontmatter tab
    before saving, and frontmatter-only or first source-mode edits now
    count as unsaved changes.
  - `LayoutProvider` accepts the server's `isEditing` state, so
    prerendered pages render their real layout (sidebar, breadcrumbs,
    header controls) in the HTML instead of falling back to client
    rendering.
  - The Lexical editor is no longer part of every page's JavaScript:
    `@jpmorganchase/mosaic-content-editor-plugin` exposes subpath exports
    (`/useEditMode`, `/LayoutNamesContext`, `/components/EditorControls`,
    …) and the site lazy-loads the editor from a Client Component.
  - Loader caches never store not-found results. Active mode can opt in to
    cross-request caching with `MOSAIC_ACTIVE_MODE_CACHE=true`. Compiled
    MDX is cached by content hash.
  - `/api/revalidate` expires the content cache immediately
    (`{ expire: 0 }`) rather than serving stale content once more.
  - Per-page stores are released when the page unmounts (`disposeStore`)
    instead of leaking a store and a `storage` listener per navigation.
  
  ### Additions
  
  - `@jpmorganchase/mosaic-content-editor-plugin`: `EditModeProvider`,
    `useIsEditing` and `useEditModeActions`; `<Editor route>` prop.
  - `@jpmorganchase/mosaic-store`: `registerStore` and `disposeStore`.
  - `@jpmorganchase/mosaic-site-middleware`, `-layouts` and
    `-site-components` now declare `next` as a peer dependency.

### Patch Changes

- 0c4d822: Migrate the Mosaic site from Next.js Pages Router to App Router (React Server Components, Auth.js v5, server-compiled MDX, optional static export)
  
  ## What changed
  
  The reference Mosaic site (`@jpmorganchase/mosaic-site`) and the shared
  packages it depends on have been ported from the Next.js Pages Router to
  the App Router. Pages-Router-only APIs in the shared packages have been
  removed, and a new static-export build target has been added.
  
  ### Breaking changes
  
  **`@jpmorganchase/mosaic-site-middleware` — major**
  
  - **The Pages Router middleware chain is removed.** `withMosaicMode`,
    `withMDXContent`, `withSharedConfig`, `withSearchIndex`, `withSession`,
    `middlewarePresets`, `createMiddlewareRunner` and the
    `fromGetServerSidePropsContext` adapter are gone.
  - **Replaced by cached loaders** that App Router routes call directly
    (in parallel): `getMdxRaw`, `getSharedConfig`, `getSearchData`,
    `getMdxRawSource`, `getTagSuggestions`, `loadSitemap` and
    `resolveMosaicMode`. Each is deduplicated per request with
    `React.cache` and cached across requests with `unstable_cache`, tagged
    `MOSAIC_CONTENT_CACHE_TAG` (also exported from the side-effect-free
    `@jpmorganchase/mosaic-site-middleware/cache-tags` subpath).
  - **MDX is compiled with `serializeMdxForClient`** (built on
    `next-mdx-remote-client/serialize`, with server-side shiki
    highlighting). It returns a JSON-safe `{ compiledSource, frontmatter, scope }` payload that a client `<MDXClient />` renders.
  
  **`@jpmorganchase/mosaic-site-components` — major**
  
  - **`Body` removed.** Render MDX with a renderer from
    `createMdxRenderer({ components })` fed by `serializeMdxForClient`.
    See `packages/site/src/app/[...route]/BodyServer.tsx` and
    `MdxComponents.ts` for the reference implementation.
  - **`Document` removed.** App Router has no `_document.tsx`; the file
    was transitively pulling `next/document` and breaking App Router
    builds. Inline what you need into your `app/layout.tsx`.
  - **Subpath exports widened** (`./*`) so consumers can deep-import
    individual modules (e.g.
    `@jpmorganchase/mosaic-site-components/Metadata`) without paying for
    the full bundle.
  
  **`@jpmorganchase/mosaic-layouts` — major**
  
  - **`useIsLoading` hook removed.** `router.events` no longer exists in
    the App Router.
  - **`Fade` component removed** (was only consumed by `LayoutBase` via
    `useIsLoading`).
  - **`Edit` layout** is selected by `LayoutProvider` from the edit mode
    instead of reacting to `router.events.routeChangeStart`.
  
  ### Non-breaking additions
  
  **`@jpmorganchase/mosaic-site` (App Router cut-over)**
  
  - New file tree under `src/app/` (`layout.tsx`, `providers.tsx`,
    `[...route]/page.tsx`, `not-found.tsx`, `error.tsx`, `robots.ts`,
    `sitemap.ts`, `api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`,
    `api/revalidate/route.ts`).
  - The editor's preview compile and save are Server Actions
    (`previewAction.ts`, `persistAction.ts`), replacing the
    `/api/content/preview` route and the browser-side workflows WebSocket.
  - **Auth.js v5** wiring in `src/auth.ts` (`handlers`, `auth`, `signIn`,
    `signOut`), replacing `next-auth` v4. `AUTH_SECRET` is required when
    auth is enabled; `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` continues to work as a fallback.
  - **Static-export build target.** `yarn build:static:file` produces a
    fully-static `out/` directory servable from any CDN with no Node
    runtime. Gated behind `MOSAIC_OUTPUT=export` and
    `MOSAIC_MODE=snapshot-file`.
  - **`next.config.js`** refactored into `baseConfig` / `dynamicOnlyConfig`
    / `exportConfig`.
  
  **`@jpmorganchase/mosaic-cli` — patch**
  
  - New `revalidateNotifier`: when `MOSAIC_REVALIDATE_URL` and
    `MOSAIC_REVALIDATE_SECRET` are set, the CLI's `serve` command POSTs to
    the site's `/api/revalidate` whenever a source emits an update, so
    tagged caches are flushed automatically. No-op when the env vars are
    absent.
  
  ## Benefits
  
  - **Parallel data loading.** Frontmatter, shared config and the search
    index are resolved in parallel rather than serially through
    `getServerSideProps`, and identical reads collapse onto one fetch.
  - **Server-side MDX work.** Parsing, compiling and syntax highlighting
    run on the server; the browser only evaluates the compiled page.
  - **Static export** unlocks CDN-only deployments (S3 + CloudFront,
    nginx, …). A reference Docker image lives at
    `examples/docker/static-export/`.
  - **Revalidate notifier** keeps sites' caches fresh when sources push
    updates.
  - **Node 24** across all in-repo Dockerfiles.
  
  ## Migration guide
  
  1. Replace `pages/_app.tsx` with `app/layout.tsx` + `app/providers.tsx`
     (`'use client'`). Mount `<SessionProvider>` without a server-resolved
     session.
  2. Replace `pages/[...route].tsx` with `app/[...route]/page.tsx`, calling
     the `@jpmorganchase/mosaic-site-middleware` loaders.
  3. Replace every `from 'next/router'` import with `next/navigation` and
     mark the file `'use client'`.
  4. Convert `pages/api/*.ts` to `app/api/*/route.ts`.
  5. Add `AUTH_SECRET` to your env if you enable Auth.js.
  
  The full guide, including environment variable and CLI changes, is in
  `docs/getting-started/migrate-to-app-router.mdx`.
  
  For static-export deployments, see
  `docs/configure/modes/static-export.mdx`.
- d1c795e: Align React peer dependencies with supported consumers. The store, icons, theme,
  OpenAPI component and sitemap component accept React 18 or 19 and matching type
  packages. Components and site components require React 19 types, matching their
  existing React 19 runtime peer and the Next.js 16 site integration.
- 2ecdf25: Use the React 19 line of next-mdx-remote-client in the App Router host and published MDX renderer/compiler. Align their React and React DOM minimum with its React 19.1 requirement, including the workspace test renderer. The editor's serialization type contract accepts both MDX runtime majors. Update SWR and Zustand minimums so existing consumers replace older React 18-only dependency selections when installing the snapshot.
- 915b9ae: Fix issues found in a review of the App Router site
  
  **`@jpmorganchase/mosaic-store`**
  
  - Add `reseedStore(store, state)`. It replaces a store's page state with
    a new seed while keeping the colour mode and actions; keys missing
    from the new seed return to their defaults. The reference site's
    `StoreShell` uses it so the sidebar, table of contents and breadcrumbs
    follow `router.refresh()`, which previously only updated the page
    body.
  
  **`@jpmorganchase/mosaic-site-middleware`**
  
  - In `snapshot-file` mode, `getMdxRaw` and `getSharedConfig` decode
    percent-encoded routes before reading files, so pages whose names
    contain spaces or non-ASCII characters are found. Decoded paths that
    would leave the snapshot (`..` or `.` segments, backslashes, NUL bytes)
    are treated as not found.
  
  **`@jpmorganchase/mosaic-site-components`**
  
  - The header's Login link no longer causes a hydration mismatch. Its
    fallback `href` is built from the router pathname (which the server
    and the browser agree on) instead of `window.location`; the click
    handler still sends the full path, query and hash as the callback.
  
  **`@jpmorganchase/mosaic-content-editor-plugin`**
  
  - The `next` peer dependency is now `^15.5.28 || ^16.4.1`. Earlier
    releases are affected by critical remote code execution advisories
    (GHSA-2xp9-vwfh-vxw4, GHSA-p293-qw3h-jr36).
  
  **Reference site (`packages/site`)**
  
  - Creating a page (`?new=1`) no longer returns 404 unless the dev
    capability bypass is on: the check now uses the shared config of the
    folder the new page goes into.
  - `not-found.tsx` no longer loads data on the server, because Next.js
    renders it as part of every page response. The 404 page loads the
    header for the section the reader was in from the browser. In
    `next dev` it now really recovers from 404s served while the CLI is
    still loading: it reloads the page once the URL resolves
    (`router.refresh()` can't clear a 404), and shows nothing extra on
    genuine 404s.
  - Every page now gets `<link rel="canonical">` from its `route`
    frontmatter, so folder URLs and aliases point at the page in every
    content mode, and folder URLs are rewritten to the canonical route in
    snapshot modes too.
  - `error.tsx` retries with Next.js 16.3's `retry()`, which re-renders
    Server Components; a new `global-error.tsx` handles root-layout
    failures.
  - `MOSAIC_OUTPUT=standalone` emits the `.next/standalone` server that
    the Dockerfiles copy into their runtime images; `next.config.js` had
    stopped emitting it in 2024. The Dockerfiles now set it.
  - `yarn build:static:*` works again. The generated API route and Server
    Action stubs accept any arguments, so the tests type-checked during
    the build compile, and `sitemap.ts` no longer sets `revalidate = 0`,
    which `output: 'export'` rejects. The sitemap is now regenerated every
    five minutes in snapshot builds and stays per-request in active mode.
  - Sites without auth no longer request `/api/auth/session` on every page
    load.
  - The site's ESLint config loads again and `yarn lint` now covers the
    site. It failed with "Cannot redefine plugin react-hooks" because the
    root used `eslint-plugin-react-hooks@5` while `eslint-config-next`
    ships `@7`; the root now uses `^7.0.0`.

  This source pulls a single Readme.md from a remote Source repo.
  Typically used for third-party repos which exist already or don't want to
  create a full document hierachy and use `@jpmorganchase/mosaic-source-git-repo`.
  By pulling a single page, we can add metadata to that page via the source's config.
  It's also more performant as we do not need to pull a whole source repo.

  The theme variables are now globally scoped and prefixed with `mosaic`.

  ## BrokenLinksPlugin

  The `BrokenLinksPlugin` uses a running instance of mosaic to verify that all links in the source pages are alive.

  If mosaic is running behind a corporate proxy, the `proxyEndpoint` option is required to fetch external URLs.

  Configuration:

  ```json
   {
        modulePath: '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-plugins/BrokenLinksPlugin',
        priority: -1,
        // Exclude this plugin in builds
        runTimeOnly: true,
        options: {
          baseUrl: process.env.MOSAIC_ACTIVE_MODE_URL || 'http://localhost:8080',
          proxyEndpoint: 'http://some-proxy-url'
        }
      }
  ```

  ## Next/Prev button

## 0.1.0-beta.11

### Patch Changes

- fc5d7b5: Generators can now interactively add sources

  Previously we were making local edits to our own site or examples to implement new features.
  What we wanted was the ability to create a local rig, A local rig can be used for development purposes,
  without touching our site code.

  We have added Mosaic repo commands, to enable us to generates local rigs (`yarn gen:rig`) and deploy our own
  tech docs via snapshot (`yarn gen`)

  To generate a site+snapshot from sources defined in `mosaic-generators.js`, run `yarn gen`
  To generate a dynamic site from sources defined in `mosaic-generators.js`, run `yarn gen:site`
  To generate a rig `yarn gen:rig`

  Equally these changes can be used to generate sites in other repos via the `mosaic-create-site` command.

  `yarn mosaic-create-site init` will create a `mosaic.generators.js`.

  Configure the `mosaic.generators.js` with your generator and sources, then run.

  `yarn mosaic-create-site create -i -o path/to/my-site`

  When this command is run, it will present an interactive menu of generators and output the site to `path/to/my-site`.
