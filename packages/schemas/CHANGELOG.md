### Patch Changes

- a3da0830: New Readme Source

  This source pulls a single Readme.md from a remote Source repo.
  Typically used for third-party repos which exist already or don't want to
  create a full document hierachy and use `@jpmorganchase/mosaic-source-git-repo`.
  By pulling a single page, we can add metadata to that page via the source's config.
  It's also more performant as we do not need to pull a whole source repo.

### Patch Changes

- 6d30e29f: Add new Storybook source

  Storybook stories can be extracted from Storybook and embedded into Mosaic pages.

  The stories are extracted based on a configured filter or matching tags.

  With a page created for each Story, the author can create a dynamic index of matching stories.

  eg. An index of patterns which match a specific tag

  `enableSourcePush` is now a property of the Mosaic Config file. This functionality was previously configured using an environment variable `process.env.MOSAIC_ENABLE_SOURCE_PUSH`

  ### Refactor

  Fastify is now used as the web server powering the `serve` functionality of the Mosaic CLI.

### Patch Changes

- 6caa661a: ### Feature

  Multiple instances of the same Plugin can be used by setting `allowMultiple` to true for all plugin definitions in the `mosaic.config.mjs` file that use that plugin.

  If there are multiple plugin definitions and only some have `allowMultiple` set to true then those are used and the definitions that do not set `allowMultiple` are discarded.

### Patch Changes

- 898c9ad: Feature: Source Schedules

  Sources that pull content from a remote source, need to poll the source to ensure that any updates are pulled into the mosaic filesystem.

  Source Schedules provide the ability to specify a global schedule that is applied to all sources, but with the ability to override this for individual sources.

  A schedule is defined as:

  ```json
    schedule: {
      checkIntervalMins: 0.2,
      initialDelayMs: 2000
    },
  ```

  Add the above to the root of a mosaic config file to set up a "global" schedule or to a specific source definition to set up a schedule for that source.

  The remote sources listed below have been updated to ensure compatibility with source schedules:

  - @jpmorganchase/mosaic-source-git-repo
  - @jpmorganchase/mosaic-source-http

- 5cd5a87: ## Feature: Source Retries

  The source retries feature gracefully handles re-requesting content from a source that has thrown an error. Retries follow an exponential back-off strategy and will eventually rethrow the error when all retry attempts have been exhausted.

  The retry configuration is specified as part of the source schedule e.g.

  ```
    schedule: {
      checkIntervalMins: 0.2,
      initialDelayMs: 2000,
      retryDelayMins: 5,
      maxRetries: 30,
      retryEnabled: true
    },
  ```

### Patch Changes

- a56eadb: ## Source Pushing

  The Mosaic CLI provides an endpoint `/sources/add/` that allows a new source to be pushed to a running instance of Mosaic.

  To do this you make a POST request with a JSON body composed of

  - a `name` property
  - a `definition` property

  ### Example request body

  Pushing a new git repo source:

  ```
  {
      "name":"my-docs-preview",
      "definition": {
        "modulePath": "@jpmorganchase/mosaic-source-git-repo",
        "namespace": "my-docs",
        "options": {
          "credentials":<access-token>,
          "prefixDir": "my-docs",
          "cache": true,
          "subfolder": "docs",
          "repo": <repo-url>,
          "branch": "main",
          "extensions": [".mdx"],
          "remote": "origin"
        }
      }
  }
  ```

  ## Notes

  By default, these sources are marked as a "preview" which means `preview-` is appended to the source namespace and certain plugins will not be run on this source e.g. search and sitemap plugins.

  You can disabled this behavior in 2 ways:

  1. send the property `isPreview` with the value of false as part of the POST request body
  2. modify plugin definitions in the mosaic config file to set `previewDisabled` to be false for all plugins you wish have run on this source.

  The theme variables are now globally scoped and prefixed with `mosaic`.

  ## BrokenLinksPlugin

  The `BrokenLinksPlugin` uses a running instance of mosaic to verify that all links in the source pages are alive.

  If mosaic is running behind a corporate proxy, the `proxyEndpoint` option is required to fetch external URLs.

  Configuration:

  ```json
   {
        modulePath: '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-plugins/BrokenLinksPlugin',
        priority: -1,
        // Exclude this plugin in builds
        runTimeOnly: true,
        options: {
          baseUrl: process.env.MOSAIC_ACTIVE_MODE_URL || 'http://localhost:8080',
          proxyEndpoint: 'http://some-proxy-url'
        }
      }
  ```

- fc5d7b5: Generators can now interactively add sources

  Previously we were making local edits to our own site or examples to implement new features.
  What we wanted was the ability to create a local rig, A local rig can be used for development purposes,
  without touching our site code.

  We have added Mosaic repo commands, to enable us to generates local rigs (`yarn gen:rig`) and deploy our own
  tech docs via snapshot (`yarn gen`)

  To generate a site+snapshot from sources defined in `mosaic-generators.js`, run `yarn gen`
  To generate a dynamic site from sources defined in `mosaic-generators.js`, run `yarn gen:site`
  To generate a rig `yarn gen:rig`

  Equally these changes can be used to generate sites in other repos via the `mosaic-create-site` command.

  `yarn mosaic-create-site init` will create a `mosaic.generators.js`.

  Configure the `mosaic.generators.js` with your generator and sources, then run.

  `yarn mosaic-create-site create -i -o path/to/my-site`

  When this command is run, it will present an interactive menu of generators and output the site to `path/to/my-site`.
