# {meta.title}

In this guide you will learn how to generate and serve a Mosaic site.

## Prerequisites

To begin setting up a Mosaic site, you need to have the following software installed:

1.  Yarn v1
2.  Node.js v18 or higher

## Step 1: Generate a Mosaic site

Run the following command in your project directory to generate a new Mosaic site:

```bash
npx @jpmorganchase/mosaic-create-site create -o my-sample-site
```

This command creates a new Mosaic site in the my-sample-site directory.

Next, navigate to the site directory:

```bash
cd my-sample-site
```

## Step 2: Serve the site

The example site you have generated comes preconfigured with two [sources](../configure/sources/index): a remote repository and a local docs folder. Sources are used by Mosaic to pull content from disparate locations and merge them into a single virtual filesystem that can be used by a Mosaic site.

### Set up Git credentials

If you want the site to read from remote repositories, you need to set up an environment variable to store your Git credentials. Follow these steps:

1.  Open a terminal or command prompt.

2.  Replace `<repo_username>` and `<personal_access_token>` in the following commands with your actual Git username and personal access token.

On Unix:

```bash
export MOSAIC_DOCS_CLONE_CREDENTIALS="<repo_username>:<personal_access_token>"
```

On Windows:

```bash
set MOSAIC_DOCS_CLONE_CREDENTIALS="<repo_username>:<personal_access_token>"
```

This sets the MOSAIC\_DOCS\_CLONE\_CREDENTIALS environment variable with your Git credentials.

### Serve command

Now you can serve your Mosaic site by running the following command:

```bash
yarn serve
```

Access your Mosaic site from a browser using the following URLs:

*   To browse the content from your local source: http://localhost:3000/local
*   To browse the content from the Mosaic Git repo source: http://localhost:3000/mosaic

That's it! Your Mosaic site is now up and running.

## Next Steps:

1.  [Deploy your Mosaic site to AWS or Vercel for production use.](../publish/index)
2.  [Create more pages to expand your site's content.](../author/index)
3.  [Configure your own sources in the mosaic.config.mjs file to pull content from different locations.](../configure/sources/index)
4.  [Theme your site](../configure/theme/index)
