# {meta.title}

The Local Folder Source is used to pull content from a folder located on the same machine as Mosaic is running.

It is common to use this source when running mosaic locally.

## Installation

`yarn add @jpmorganchase/mosaic-source-local-folder`

## Configuration

| Property           | Description                                                                    | Required |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| modulePath         | The path to the installed module (@jpmorganchase/mosaic-source-local-folder)   | Yes      |
| namspace           | The scope for this source.                                                     | Yes      |
| options.rootDir    | The top level directory content will be pulled from                            | Yes      |
| options.prefixDir  | The root path used in the content URL                                          | Yes      |
| options.extensions | Collection of file extensions that the source will look for inside the rootDir | Yes      |

### Example Local Folder Source Definition

```
{
    modulePath: '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-source-local-folder',
    namespace: 'local', // each site has it's own namespace, think of this as your content's uid
    options: {
    rootDir: '../../docs', // relative path to content
    prefixDir: 'local', // root path used for namespace
    extensions: ['.mdx'] // extensions of content which should be pulled
    }
}
```

This source will look for content with the ".mdx" extension in a "docs" directory 2 levels up from the Mosaic working directory. That content is included in the "local" namespace and available from a route that is prefixed with "local".

So if you had a file, `docs/app/index.mdx` then you would be able to view it at `http://localhost:3000/local/app/index`.
