# {meta.title}

A source schedule defines how often a source initiates a content pull and what to do when their is a failure.

A schedule can be specified for each source in the source definition, but should a source not provide a schedule it will inherit the "global" schedule.

## Configuration

| Property          | Description                                                                            | Required | Default |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| checkIntervalMins | The length of time in minutes before triggering a content refresh                      | Yes      | 30 mins |
| initialDelayMs    | Startup delay for the source.                                                          | Yes      | 1000 ms |
| retryEnabled      | When true, failures will trigger another content pull                                  | No       | true    |
| retryDelayMins    | The interval between retries. This will rise exponentially on every failure.           | No       | 5       |
| maxRetries        | Maximum number of retry attempts                                                       | No       | 100     |
| resetOnSuccess    | If true, when a source recovers and emits pages it's retry counter is returned to zero | No       | true    |

## Global Schedule

The global schedule applies to all sources that do **not** provide their own schedule. It can be configured as a top-level property of the Mosaic config file.

```json
 schedule: {
    checkIntervalMins: 60,
    initialDelayMs: 1000,
    retryDelayMins: 15,
    maxRetries: 20
  }
```

### Example

Given the config file below:

```json
 schedule: {
    checkIntervalMins: 30,
    initialDelayMs: 1000,
    retryDelayMins: 5,
    maxRetries: 10
  },
  sources: [
    {
      modulePath: '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-source-git-repo',
      namespace: 'sourceA',
      options: {
        credentials: 'credentials',
        prefixDir: 'sourceA',
        subfolder: 'docs',
        repo: 'source-a-repo-url',
        branch: 'develop',
        extensions: ['.mdx'],
        remote: 'origin'
      }
    },
    {
      modulePath: '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-source-git-repo',
      namespace: 'sourceB',
      schedule:{
        checkIntervalMins: 60,
        initialDelayMs: 5000,
        retryDelayMins: 30,
        maxRetries: 50
      }
      options: {
        credentials: 'credentials',
        prefixDir: 'sourceB',
        subfolder: 'docs',
        repo: 'source-b-repo-url',
        branch: 'develop',
        extensions: ['.mdx'],
        remote: 'origin'
      }
    }
  ]
```

Source A will inherit the global schedule so it will:

*   Start after a 1 second delay
*   Pull content every 30 minutes
*   Retry a failed content pull after an initial 5 minute delay
*   Retry 10 times and if still unsuccessful, closing

Source B has its own schedule so it will:

*   Start after a 5 second delay
*   Pull content every 60 minutes
*   Retry a failed content pull after an initial 30 minute delay
*   Retry 50 times and if still unsuccessful, closing

## Retry Strategy

The retry strategy that Mosaic employs is [Exponential Backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff). This is a common strategy for networking applications that aims to prevent retries from causing more harm than good.

For example, given a source schedule that has a 1 minute retry delay and will retry a maximum of 3 times then the total time spent retrying is 7 minutes:

*   1 minute delay then 1st retry
*   2 minute delay then 2nd retry
*   4 minute delay then 3rd (and final) retry

Total delay: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 minutes

As you can see, the delay between retries is growing exponentially giving the content source more time to recover after each retry.
