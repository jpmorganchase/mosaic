# {meta.title}

A Mosaic site is a [Next.Js](https://nextjs.org/) app.

To publish a Next.Js App to Vercel, refer to the [Vercel docs](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/deploying-nextjs-app/deploy).

## Deployment

As the [vercel platform](https://vercel.com/) hosts static content you will need to deploy a mosaic snapshot. There is no option to run mosaic in [active mode](../configure/modes/active).

### 1. Update Config File

Add the following to the mosaic config file used by your site:

```
 deployment: { mode: 'snapshot-file', platform: 'vercel' }
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables

Set 2 [environment variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/environments#environment-variables) in the vercel dashboard.

| Variable Name       | Value             |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| MOSAIC_MODE         | snapshot-file     |
| MOSAIC_SNAPSHOT_DIR | snapshots/latest. |

### 3. Run Build and Deploy

The `build` command used by vercel must run `yarn build` followed by `yarn deploy`

The `deploy` command is needed to workaround an [output file tracing](#output-file-tracing) problem.

Example:

```
yarn build && yarn deploy
```

## Output File Tracing

[Output File Tracing](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/output-file-tracing) is a feature of Next.js that uses static analysis
to determine what files are needed to deploy a production version of an application.

Due to the architecture of mosaic, snapshot files can be ignored by this process and therefore excluded from the build artifacts deployed by vercel.

If you are deploying your site to the [vercel platform](https://vercel.com/) then the mosaic site has a `deploy` command that will update the nextjs output trace to include the snapshot files.
