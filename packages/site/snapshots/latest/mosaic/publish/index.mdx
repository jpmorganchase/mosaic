# {meta.title}

A *standard* site offers

* an out the box, working site, which showcases local and remote content sources
* a minimal set of files that can be configured with your own components, themes, layouts, sources and plugins
* an update path that enables you to update Mosaic, independently of your own configuration

## Create your first site

Duplicate the `site` package from the Mosaic monorepo to create your own site.

```
> git clone https://github.com/jpmorganchase/mosaic.git
> cp -r mosaic/packages/site mosaic-sample-site
> cd mosaic-sample-site
```

Define the environment variable, which enables us to access your remote repo.

```
> export MOSAIC_DOCS_CLONE_CREDENTIALS="<your GIT username:PAT Token>"
```

The `MOSAIC_DOCS_CLONE_CREDENTIALS` environment variable is composed of your git username and your PAT token.
Follow these [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to see how to create your own PAT token.

Your site is ready to run.

```
> yarn serve
```

In your browser load `http://localhost:3000`

Congratulations, you have created your first Mosaic site.
