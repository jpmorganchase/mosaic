# {meta.title}

Mosaic can operate in 3 different modes

- `active`
- `snapshot-file`
- `snapshot-s3`

## Active updates

In _active_ mode, content updates in real-time.

_active_ mode content is pulled at configured intervals in real-time, as defined by `mosaic.config.js`.

Read the [active](./active) configuration docs.

## Static content

Consider a snapshot as a directory of static content previously pulled from your content sources, which does not update itself.

In a snapshot mode, the snapshot does update itself.

### File based snapshots

In `snapshot-file` mode, immutable snapshots of content are loaded at startup from the local file-system.

Read the [snapshot-file](./snapshot-file) configuration docs.

### S3 based snapshots

In `snapshot-s3` mode, snapshots of content are loaded at startup from a remote S3 bucket.

Read the [snapshot-s3](./snapshot-s3) configuration docs.
