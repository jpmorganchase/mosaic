# {meta.title}

Tags are very similar to [Refs](./refs) with one very important distinction: Tags work **across multiple sources**.

In Mosaic, each source has it's own filesystem which are then merged together to form a union of all source filesystems. It is in this union filesystem that tags are applied and not to the individual source filesystem that the tag was defined on.

<Callout variant="warning">
  Tags are slower to apply than refs. Multiple sources need to run and update before tagged data
  will be resolved. If possible, stick to refs and only use tags when dealing with multiple sources.
</Callout>

## Tagging a page

To tag a page, add a `tags` property to the page frontmatter. For example, the Product A page is tagged with "in-stock":

```
---
title: Product A
description: Mosaic Product A
layout: ProductDiscover
tags:
  - in-stock
data:
  name:
    $ref: '#/title'
---
```

<Callout>`tags` is always an array</Callout>

## Subscribing to a tag

To subscribe to a tag, use the `$tag` property. For example, the Products page has subscribed to the `data` property of pages tagged with `in-stock`.

```
---
title: Products
data:
  in-stock:
    $tag: in-stock#/data
---
```

<Callout>
  A `$tag` can provide a path to a specific piece of metadata on tagged pages, just like a ref.
</Callout>

### Example

This page has subscribed to `in-stock` and `out-of-stock` tags and is displaying them using 2 Mosaic `PageFilterView` components.

Both the Product A and Product B pages are part of a different source than this page.

#### In Stock

<PageFilterView view={meta.data['in-stock']} />

#### Out of Stock

<PageFilterView view={meta.data['out-of-stock']} />
