# {meta.title}

[Frontmatter](https://mdxjs.com/guides/frontmatter/), also known as page metadata, is a powerful feature that allows easy configuration of a page and Mosaic site components e.g. the sidebar.

Frontmatter is written in yaml syntax and is found at the top of a page between 2 sets of 3 dashes: `---`.

## Example page yaml

```
---
title: Page Title
layout: DetailTechnical
sidebar:
  priority: 4
---

// frontmatter is closed and now comes page content
# Page Title

This is some content.

```

## Accessing Frontmatter in content

With the syntax below it is possible to directly reference frontmatter inside content using curly brackets and the `meta` object.

You can think of `meta` as a JSON object that holds all the frontmatter of a page and when the Mosaic `RefPlugin` encounters the curly brackets then the value in the frontmatter will be resolved.

```
{meta.title}
{meta.description}
{meta.someValueYouHaveAddedToTheFrontmatter}
```

This is very common to see Mosaic pages that reference the title as shown below:

```
---
title: Title
---

# {meta.title}
```

## Plugins & Frontmatter

Mosaic plugins can also embed their output into page frontmatter. They can do this in a couple of ways:

- a property is directly added to the page in a lifecycle event
- a file is generated and a ref is added to the frontmatter that will be resolved by the `RefPlugin`

### Adding a property to the page

A plugin can add a property to a page simply by extending the page object it receives in the `$afterSource` lifecycle event:

```
async function $afterSource(pages, { config, ignorePages, pageExtensions }) {
  for (const page of pages) {
    page.newProperty = 'Hello'
  }
  return pages;
}
```

You could use this property in the page content using `{meta.newProperty}`

### File Output and Ref
