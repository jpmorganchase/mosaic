# {meta.title}

Refs are a very powerful feature of Mosaic documents that use [JSON References](https://json-spec.readthedocs.io/reference.html) to reference
a property from the page frontmatter or frontmatter of other pages.

The key concept is that of a JSON pointer which takes the form **A**#**B** where:

*   **A** is the relative path from the current schema to a target schema. If A is empty, the reference is to a type or property in the same schema, an in-schema reference. Otherwise, the reference is to a different schema, a cross-schema reference.
*   **B** is the complete path from the root of the schema to a type or property in the schema. If # in not included or B is empty, the reference is to an entire schema.

To translate this for our purposes:

*   **A** is the relative path to a file in the filesystem.
*   **B** is the path to a property in the frontmatter of the file.

It's probably better explained with examples...

## Local refs (In-schema reference)

It is possible to reference a page's own frontmatter to avoid duplication:

```
---
title: Refs
layout: DetailTechnical
sidebar:
  priority: 3
data:
  sidebarPriority:
     $ref: '#/sidebar/priority'
---
```

This page you are reading right now has a sidebar priority of **{meta.data.sidebarPriority}**.

The value of `data.sidebarPriority` comes from `sidebar.priority` in the frontmatter.

<Callout>
  Notice that because we don't specify a path before the `#` in the ref we need to put the whole
  value inside quotes.
</Callout>

## Remote Refs (Cross-schema reference)

It is possible to reference frontmatter of other pages. Again this helps avoid duplication but the real power is using refs to build the data model. See [advanced](#advanced) for more information.

The [index](./index) page of the Author section has this frontmatter:

```
---
title: Author
layout: DetailTechnical
sidebar:
  priority: 3
data:
  exampleRefData: Hello from Author page
---
```

This page you are currently looking at is referencing the `data.exampleRefData` in it's frontmatter like this:

```
---
title: Refs
layout: DetailTechnical
sidebar:
  priority: 3
data:
  authorRef:
    $ref: ./#/data/exampleRefData
---
```

I can then use the data and embed it in this page like this:

```
{meta.data.authorRef}
```

And here it is: <strong>{meta.data.authorRef}</strong>

<Callout>
  Notice that we did not need to put `/index` in the ref since index pages are resolved
  automatically.
</Callout>

## Advanced

You have had a taste of the power and want to know more? OK, lets reference and then list out all the mosaic modes:

<ul>
  {meta.data.modes.map(mode => (
    <li key={mode}>{mode}</li>
  ))}
</ul>

The Modes [index](../configure/modes/index) page has this frontmatter:

```
---
title: Modes of operation
layout: DetailTechnical
sidebar:
  priority: 4
data:
  modes:
    $ref: ./*#/title
---
```

The ref here is essentially using a wildcard (the \*) to grab the `mode` property from the frontmatter of every page in the modes folder.

We can reference that data just like before:

```
---
title: Refs
layout: DetailTechnical
sidebar:
  priority: 3
data:
  modes:
    $ref: ../configure/modes#/data/modes
---
```

### Output

With the code below, the referenced data can be embedded in a page.

```
<ul>
  {meta.data.modes.map(mode => (
    <li key={mode}>{mode}</li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

### Output with Mosaic Components

You can use Mosaic components with referenced data as well. Below we are using the `Tiles` and `TileContent` components.

<Tiles>
  {meta.data.modes.map(mode => (
    <TileContent
      title={mode}
      description={`Documentation about ${mode} of Mosaic`}
      eyebrow="Mosaic"
    />
  ))}
</Tiles>

```
<Tiles>
  {meta.data.modes.map(mode => (
    <TileContent
      title={mode}
      description={`Documentation about ${mode} of Mosaic`}
      eyebrow="Mosaic"
    />
  ))}
</Tiles>
```

## Setting Refs using Plugins

Mosaic plugins can create new refs, create new *global* refs and see existing refs created by the page or other plugins. This is achieved using a special `config` property available in the plugin helpers.

### Create new refs

Use the `config.setRef` function from the helpers provided to plugin lifecycle events. You need to provide

*   The file/fullpath to write the ref to
*   The path to the ptoperty where the ref will be applied
*   The value of the ref, which can use wildcards

For example, the following would add a property to pages named `titles`. The value is the title of all pages in the **same** directory as the current page

```
  async $afterSource(pages, { config }) {
    for (const page of pages) {
      config.setRef(page.fullPath, ['titles', '$ref'], `**#/title`);
    }
    return pages;
  }
```

<Callout variant="warning">
  When setting the property path the last string must be `$ref` otherwise you're not creating a ref
  that will be resolved by the RefPlugin.
</Callout>

### Existing refs

To view refs that already exist you can use `config.data.refs`. For example to see all refs for a page:

```
 config.data.refs[fullPathToPage]
```

### Create global refs

Global refs are similar to regular refs except they do not pre-resolve. This means they are resolved when the referenced file is read and the global mosaic filesystem, made up of multiple sources, is used rather than the filesystem of a single source.
