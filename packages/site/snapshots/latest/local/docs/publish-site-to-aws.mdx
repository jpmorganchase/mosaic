# {meta.title}

A Mosaic site is a [Next.Js](https://nextjs.org/) app.

To publish a Next.Js App to AWS, deploy your app as a SSR application by following the [AWS docs](https://docs.amplify.aws/guides/hosting/nextjs/q/platform/js/).

Once the basic app has been configured, add the Mosaic specifics.

Add the environment vars to the hosted app via the Amplify console

```
MOSAIC_MODE="snapshot-s3"
MOSAIC_S3_BUCKET="<your S3 bucket id>"
MOSAIC_S3_REGION="<your S3 region>"
MOSAIC_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""<your S3 access key>"
MOSAIC_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<your S3 secret access key>"
```

Add the following build settings

```
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - yarn install
        - env | grep -e MOSAIC >> .env.production
    build:
      commands:
        - yarn run build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: .next
    files:
      - '**/*'
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/**/*
```

Ensure the Node is set to 16
