# {meta.title}

In `active` mode content can be _pulled_ from heterogeneous data sources and normalized via plugins, to the configured components/theme.
As your content changes, the site will _re-pull_ the content and update your site in real-time.

The standard generated site comes with 2 sources to demonstrate, how 'active' mode work.

- a local source, which loads content from `./docs`
- a remote source, which loads content from a [sample Github repository](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/mosaic/tree/main/docs)

## Configuring your content sources

All content is composed together within a _namespace_.

A _namespace_ is the scope for aggregated content, represented by the root path.
e.g Our sample docs are aggregated into a _namespace_ called `mosaic` and served by the user journey `http://localhost:3000/mosaic`

Mosaic doc sources are defined by a file called `mosaic.config.js`

Here is how that might look for a standard site.

## Pull your local content

To tryout local content creation, add a file called`./docs/index.mdx`

The load `http://localhost:3000/local`

Each directory should contain an `index.mdx` which is the default page, when a page is loaded without a path

Now create other pages and subdirectories and explore how Mosaic, builds your user-journeys from your fileset.

## Pull your remote content

To tryout remote content creation, your standard site comes pre-configured to load our Mosaic sample docs.

Edit the `mosaic.config.js` and change your `repoUrl` and `branch` to pull content from other repos.
