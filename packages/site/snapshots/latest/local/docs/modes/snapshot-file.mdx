# {meta.title}

In `snapshot-file` mode a local immutable snapshot can be loaded by the site. Typically, the snapshot and the site are
deployed together and upon startup the site can load the snapshot from the local file-system.

To use `snapshot-file` mode

```
export MOSAIC_MODE="snapshot-file"
export MOSAIC_SNAPSHOT_DIR="./snapshot/latest"
```

## Generating a snapshot

To generate a snapshot, run

```
yarn gen:snapshot
```

Commit the snapshot to your Git repo and push the site+snapshot to your Git repo, within the same branch.
