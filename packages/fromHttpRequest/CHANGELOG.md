  ## BrokenLinksPlugin

  The `BrokenLinksPlugin` uses a running instance of mosaic to verify that all links in the source pages are alive.

  If mosaic is running behind a corporate proxy, the `proxyEndpoint` option is required to fetch external URLs.

  Configuration:

  ```json
   {
        modulePath: '@jpmorganchase/mosaic-plugins/BrokenLinksPlugin',
        priority: -1,
        // Exclude this plugin in builds
        runTimeOnly: true,
        options: {
          baseUrl: process.env.MOSAIC_ACTIVE_MODE_URL || 'http://localhost:8080',
          proxyEndpoint: 'http://some-proxy-url'
        }
      }
  ```
