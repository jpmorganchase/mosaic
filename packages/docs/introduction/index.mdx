True to its name, Mosaic brings together several concepts—including content, design and technical infrastructure—to
deliver a unified website experience that is truly greater than the sum of its individual parts. With
Mosaic, you can:

    Experience Manager (AEM).
  </Card>
  <Card step="02" title="Easily manage your docs website">
    Focus on your content and make changes as needed.
