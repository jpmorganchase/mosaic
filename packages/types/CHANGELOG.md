## 0.1.0-beta.11

### Patch Changes

- fc5d7b5: Generators can now interactively add sources

  Previously we were making local edits to our own site or examples to implement new features.
  What we wanted was the ability to create a local rig, A local rig can be used for development purposes,
  without touching our site code.

  We have added Mosaic repo commands, to enable us to generates local rigs (`yarn gen:rig`) and deploy our own
  tech docs via snapshot (`yarn gen`)

  To generate a site+snapshot from sources defined in `mosaic-generators.js`, run `yarn gen`
  To generate a dynamic site from sources defined in `mosaic-generators.js`, run `yarn gen:site`
  To generate a rig `yarn gen:rig`

  Equally these changes can be used to generate sites in other repos via the `mosaic-create-site` command.

  `yarn mosaic-create-site init` will create a `mosaic.generators.js`.

  Configure the `mosaic.generators.js` with your generator and sources, then run.

  `yarn mosaic-create-site create -i -o path/to/my-site`

  When this command is run, it will present an interactive menu of generators and output the site to `path/to/my-site`.
